All project members are students of the University of California, Berkeley.

The project concept is by Professor Larry Rosenthal.
We also appreciate the mentorship and guidance from Professor Armando Fox (teaching us the foundations of good software practices and enforcing constant testing and refactoring to make our project maintainable) and our TA Craig Hiller (conducting our iteration reviews and keeping tabs on our progress).

Thanks to Emily Chen for helping us on the design of the poster and Martin Arreola, Jeffrey Hsu, and Erica Liu for advice regarding app aesthetics.

Go bears,
