PenPal Gladiators is a platform where users of differing political opinion can engage in open dialog and deliberative listening to not only learn about and discuss other (often rival) political points of view, but also to learn more about their own world views.

We intelligently match users using data generated by users filling out an on-boarding survey. Our algorithm matches users that have similar political topics of interest, but that have differing viewpoints on these topics, thereby increasing the likelihood of productive conversation.

Reflecting upon someone else's point of view, comparing it to your own, and ideally realizing that other points of view may have merit (even if you still believe that your original point of view makes the most sense for you) is key to the PenPal Gladiators experience. We maintain that this goal, which we call border crossing, is key to progress and a more harmonious future.))
