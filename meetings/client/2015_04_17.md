## Notes

### Progress bar

- Should have some sort of indication that it is a progress bar
- Text or percent etc.

### Conversation page

- Using Leo's code
  - Should not be centered
  - CSS Errors, buttons on top of others

### Sidebar

- Scrolling looks the same? No.
- Some controls maybe
  - Actionable controls should be ok (reply, edit, etc.)

### Consensus

- Better text string for button:
  - "Offer to summarize gladiator's view"
- New Feature: Summarize gladiator's view
  - What we have for consensus at the moment
  - Looks good for summary
  - Uneditable
