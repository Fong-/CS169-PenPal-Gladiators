## Notes

### Discussion on how to implement arena page
  - Options
    - Option 1: put it in the arena page, problem is no way to get to the arena page without a match
    - Option 2: put it in the home page
  - Should be able to choose who to be matched with
  - User should have power because that is the purpose of the site
  - Should list which people and allow the user to select, also display a summary
  - Should also allow rematching
  - Should have double approval
  - Invite + approval architecture
  - Match + approval first, then arena
  - Need a way to select topics
  - Sidebar is used to navigate to select topics, the rest of the screen is filled with content

### Discussion on how matching works
  - Matching backend before matching frontend
  - Matching algorithm
  - Answers mapped to integer
  - Differences of answers
  - Take the max
  - Either numerical score or measure of “interestingness”
  - Undecided what to do for iteration 3 need discussion of the team
