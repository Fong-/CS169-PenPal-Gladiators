## TLDR
Discussed the mockups. No major objections to the mockups. Also discussed features in more details. Some new features are proposed.

## Registration
  - Description
    - User needs (or choose?) to write a short description about themselves and/or their political stance.
    - Is displayed during matching

## Registration Survey: Topic Selection
  - Combine topic selection and survey questions (Stephen)
    - Click on topic, pop-up showing survey questions (or topic question is replaced by the questions, but probably too many questions for this)
    - Good for mobile (Stephen)

## Homepage
  - Matching
    - Instead of assigning a penpal, show multiple candidates and allow the user to decide.
    - Display some info, including their descriptions, for each candidate.
  - Share Facebook/personal info
    - Allow user to share their personal info with another gladiator
  - "Unfriend" gladiators
    - User can end their relationship with a gladiator, without their consenus.
        - Probably will prompt the user to explain why
    - Option in setting to hide "unfriended" gladiators
  - New Feeds
    - Show published threads (see below) of other users
    - Show news from other website?

## Arena page
  - Publish threads
    - After a thread is concluded with a manifesto, user can (with consenus of the other gladiator) publish the thread. Afterward, the published thread can show up News Feed of other users.
  - What should happens when user clicked on a thread
    - Scroll down to ...
        - the end of the thread?
        - the beginning of the last post?
        - the beginning of the first unread post?
            - This requires a new feature of keeping track of read and unread posts
  - Progress (Steven)
    - A way for users to keep track of what have happened in the thread so far
        - Venn diagram? left and right are for the user and their penpal respectively, the middle is common ground (editable by both)
            - Left and right: perspectives of the user and penpal (Stephen)
            - Left and right: divided into two halves (top and bottom). Top for "what I'm saying", bottom for "what I hear you said". When the top left (right) matches with bottom right (left), the middle (common ground) can be filled in. (Larry)
    - Editable summary
  - Multiple posts in a row by the same user
    - Squash them into a single post? (Kevin) 
  - Long quote
    - Show entire quotes. No hiding, ie. no "Click to see more" (Larry)
